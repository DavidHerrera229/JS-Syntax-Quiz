/* Variables & Data Types */

//Question 1: There are 8 Primitive Data Types in JavaScript, list them all 
//Note: Arrays and Objects are not primitive data-types
//Answer: 
*var, let, const, for,*  [null, undefined, boolean, number, bigint, string, symbol]<=correct answer

//Question 2: Is JavaScript a dynamically typed Language? or a Statically typed language?
//Answer: 
* dont know *    [dynamic]<-- correct

//Question 3: Variable Scoping
// Part 1 - What 2 types of scope can variables declared with the "var" keyword have?
//Answer: 
*string and value*  [global and local aka function scoped / local scoped]

//Part 2 - As of ES6 JavaScript has 2 new variable declaration keywords: "let" and "const".  
//How are let and const variables scoped?
//Answer: [let and const are block scoped]

//Part 3 - What is the difference between "let" and "const"? Hint: it has to do with variable reassignment
//Answer: 
*Const will have a consistent value?, let has assignment that can change?*
{const cannot be reassigned...let cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned. also you can change the value of a const.}answer


//Question 4:

//Part 1: Read the code written below. What is wrong with the code?

var carBrandOne = "Ford"; {<---already declared}
let carBrandOne = "Mercedes";

// comment out the code above and write a correction to the code below this  line
var carBrandOne = ("Ford");
car
{ var carBrandOne = "Ford"
  carBrandOne = "mercedes"
  let carBrandTwo = "Mercedes"}

//Part 2: Read the code written below. What is wrong with the code?

const myConstant = {id: 1, name: "Joe", favoriteSnack: "ice cream"}
myConstant = 10;

// comment out the code above and write a correction to the code below this  line
* the value cannot be a number for letter strings, unless you want to find the how many letters are in the string?*
{cannot change a const}

// Part 3: Read the code written below. What will happen? Will this throw an error?
const myConstant2 = {id: 2, name: "Bill", favoriteSnack: "potato chips"}
myConstant2["name"] = "James"
* I dont believe an error will accurr, I think the this will swap James for Bill for Constant2 string* { correct!!}

//Part 4: Read the code written below. Look at the function call below the defined function,
// Will declaring a let variables with the same name throw an error in this case? Why or why not?
// What will the function return?
* It does not create an error, not sure why it works but using let, else if & else works. { blocked scoped }
function variablesExample(number){
    let returnMessage = '';
    if(number > 10){
        let message = "the given number is larger than 10";
        returnMessage = message;
    }else if(number === 10){
        let message = "the given number is equvalent to 10";
        returnMessage = message;
    }else{
        let message = "the given number is less than 10";
        returnMessage = message;

    }
    console.log(returnMessage);
    return returnMessage;
}
variablesExample(15);

//Question 5: 

// Part-1: What are acceptable characters that you can use to start variable names?
//Answer: 
* using _ or $, then just normal letters ( alphabets / lowercaseUppercase) {correct!!}

//Part-2: What are acceptable characters that you can use to name variables (after the first character of the name)?
// Answer: * "my"  {}


/* END OF VARIABLES AND STRINGS SECTION */



/* Strings */

// Given the string below,
// Write code that will return the 8th character of the string
// Then write code that will return (or console.log) "is a"
    // Note - don't convert this string to an array
   
    *{ coolString }
    
    *coolString.length[0];
    *console.log([7]);

// How would you return the 4th from the last character from the coolString without knowing how long the string was?
*coolstring.length([0] - 4);

// Look at the variables below that have been initialized with string data.  What are the 2 ways you can concatinate these strings together?
let aString = "Back to "
let bString = "The Future"

//Write the 2 ways of concatinating the strings below this line.  Declare a new variable for the results.
*let ourString = (aString + bString);
*console.log(ourString);


/*For Loops */
// You are provided an array of strings below
// an example of a console.log is also provided

let namesArray = ["Joe", "Larry", "Bob", "James", "David", "Tim", "Jimmy", "Jessie", "Marty"];
console.log(namesArray["The first name is: ", 0]);

/*directly below this comment, 
write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray from the beginning to the end of the array and logs the names to the console */
*hmm array string only prints the first name in example, to print all the names just console.log the string alone so that it can print all the options.
*-- 

//write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray from the END to the BEGINnING of the array and logs the names to the console
*not sure to run it in reverse*
use += 2

//write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray BUT only logs every other name to the console
*not sure how to specify odd or evens yet*


/*While Loops*/

// Inside the function below, Write a while loop that will console.log("Hello World") "number" times.  Use continueBoolean in your while loop's specified condition

function whileLoopQuestion1(number){
    let continueBoolean = true;
    console.log("Hello World")
}

whileLoopQuestion1(20);


/* Array Methods */

//What does the Array.prototype.push() method do? What does it return?
*damn! not sure

//What does the Array.prototype.unshift() method do? What does it return?
*damn not sure

//What does the Array.prototype.pop() method do? What does it return?
* pop removes the last string in a group?

//What does the Array.prototype.shift() method do? What does it return?
*shift separates the first string for group.?

// What does the Array.prototype.join() method do? What does the 1 optional parameter do to modify how this method works? What does it return?
*currently at this point in lessons
//What does the Array.prototype.slice() method do? What will it return?
*currently at this point in lessons
//What does the Array.prototype.splice() method do? What will it return?
*currently at this point in lessons

//Look at the Array Below
let nestedArray = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12],[13,14,15],[16,17,18]], 19];
//How many dimensions does this array have?
4?
//How would you access the value 11?
*[3]<--dimension [1] <--value in dimensions
// how would you access the value 5?
*[1]<--dimension [1]<--value
// How would you access the last element in the array without knowing the array's length?
*.length([0]-1)?

// How would you access the 3rd element in the array?  What will that element's value be?
*[3][6]?

/* Functions */

/* Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

write a function named convertCtoF.
The function should take 1 argument.
The parameter should be named celsius.

* let convertCtoF = (celsius * 9 / 5 + 32)

Your function needs to accept an argument of a temperature in Celsius, and return the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit
Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.
convertCtoF(30); should return 86;
